This  includes metric management processes and feature/property management processes, as well as policy management processes, location management processes, and calendaring (such as appointment scheduling) when they are added, and so forth. &#xA;&#xA;A key characteristic of Common Enterprise Processes is that they can execute on their own, do represent â€œtrue&quot; business processes, but may require specialization. For example, a policy can be defined and associated with Catalog Specification to govern the content of catalogs described by the specification; or the specification of a loyalty rule may represent a specialization of the process that defines a policy rule."/>

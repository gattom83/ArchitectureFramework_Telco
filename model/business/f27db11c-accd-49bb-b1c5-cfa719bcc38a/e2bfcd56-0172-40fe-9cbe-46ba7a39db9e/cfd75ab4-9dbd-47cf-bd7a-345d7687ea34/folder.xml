The consumption of available capacity by demand is captured for a given time period.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Capacity Management specifies available capacity and captures capacity demand for defined time periods.  The consumption of available capacity by demand is captured for a given time period.  Available capacity and/or capacity demand may be adjusted based on consumption or other factors, such as reduced infrastructure availability.  Available capacity and capacity demand can be specified as planned or actual.&#xA;&#xA;Domain specific capacity management processes, such as Product Capacity Management contain only the processes specific to them.  For example, associating product offering with capacity amounts and capacity demand.&#xA;&#xA;Generalized processes such as this eliminate redundant processes used to create domain specific capacity management processes."/>

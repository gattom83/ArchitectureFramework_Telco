Configure or create a new version of a configuration for an entity, such as a product, service, or resource, as defined by a configuration specification. Modify a configuration and values for configuration parameters, and remove a configuration.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Configuration Specification and Configuration Management defines, modifies, and removes a configuration specification that defines how an entity, such as a product, service, or resource functions. This process also configures or creates a new version of a configuration for an entity, such as a product, service, or resource, as defined by a configuration specification. It also modifies a configuration and values for configuration parameters, and removes a configuration.&#xA;&#xA;Domain specific configuration management processes, such as Product Configuration Management contain only the processes specific to them.  For example, associating a product specification with product configuration specification and a product with a product configuration.&#xA;&#xA;Generalized processes such as this eliminate redundant processes used to create domain specific configuration management processes."/>

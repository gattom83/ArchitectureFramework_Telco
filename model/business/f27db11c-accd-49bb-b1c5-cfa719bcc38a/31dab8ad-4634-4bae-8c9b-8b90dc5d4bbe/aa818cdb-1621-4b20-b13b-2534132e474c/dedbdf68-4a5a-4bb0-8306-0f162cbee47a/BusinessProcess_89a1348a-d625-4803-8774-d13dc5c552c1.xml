    documentation="Process Context&#xA;This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modelled in business process terms, and can be applied (i.e. â€œinstantiated&quot;) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.&#xA;Brief Description&#xA;These processes capture all activities required to develop a business case to develop and deliver the required capabilities, including identification of potential partners. The business case should identify any required product infrastructure components, development costs and anticipated benefits, including revenue gains, productivity gains, performance improvements and/or operational cost improvements. The business case should also include a general view of the types of product offers which could be developed and deployed using the product infrastructure, but would not necessarily include a specific proposal to launch a specific product. This later activity is managed by the PLM processes.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Not used for this process element&#xA;Explanatory&#xA;Reserved for future use."/>

The business case should identify any required product infrastructure components, development costs and anticipated benefits, including revenue gains, productivity gains, performance improvements and/or operational cost improvements. The business case should also include a general view of the types of product offers which could be developed and deployed using the product infrastructure, but would not necessarily include a specific proposal to launch a specific product. This later activity is managed by the PLM processes. The processes include any cross-enterprise co-ordination and management functions to ensure that the business case is supported by all stakeholders.&#xA;Explanatory&#xA;Reserved for future use.&#xA;Mandatory&#xA;Reserved for future use."/>

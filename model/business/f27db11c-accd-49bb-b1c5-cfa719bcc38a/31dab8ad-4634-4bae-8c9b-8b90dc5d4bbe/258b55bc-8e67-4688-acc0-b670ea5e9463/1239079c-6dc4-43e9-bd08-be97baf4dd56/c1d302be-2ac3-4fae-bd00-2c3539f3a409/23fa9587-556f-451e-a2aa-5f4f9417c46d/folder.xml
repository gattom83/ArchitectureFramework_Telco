    documentation="Brief Description&#xA;Develop the product specification, develop the required non-configurable product specification features, as well as other commercial aspects of the specification.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Develop Detailed Product Commercial Specifications develops the product specification, which also includes grouping/bundling of specifications and versioning of the specifications. Groups/bundles may include specifications on-boarded from other parties. Required non-configurable features known as characteristics are developed.&#xA;&#xA;The process also associates the specification with one or more product lines and/or product categories.  If a product line or category does not exist one is created.  Associations to suggested pricing for product offerings based on the specification are also developed.&#xA;&#xA;Associations between and among product specifications are developed.  These associations represent business rules, such as migration, substitution, dependency, or exclusivity between and among the specifications.&#xA;&#xA;The process ensures that all detailed specifications are produced and appropriately documented. Additionally the processes ensure that the documentation is captured in an appropriate enterprise repository.&#xA;&#xA;Note:  To minimize the number of sub-processes that update and remove various aspects of a product specification, such as groupings and features, it is assumed that the sub-processes also perform updates and removals."/>

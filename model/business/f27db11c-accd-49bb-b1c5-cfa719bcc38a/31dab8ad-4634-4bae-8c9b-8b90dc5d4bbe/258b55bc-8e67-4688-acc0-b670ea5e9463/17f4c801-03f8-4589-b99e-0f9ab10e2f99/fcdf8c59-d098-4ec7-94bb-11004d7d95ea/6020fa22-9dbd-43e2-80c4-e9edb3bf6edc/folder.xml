    documentation="Brief Description&#xA;Conduct acceptance testing of new and enhanced products in preparation for launch/rollout to the market.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Conduct Product Offering Acceptance Testing  manages acceptance testing of a new and enhanced product offering into the market and handover for ongoing rollout. Acceptance testing is conducted using commercial pilots or market trials of the offering or prototypes of it, in which case the commercial negotiations for the pilot and/or trial are managed through these processes. These processes identify the shortcomings or issues, and manage the necessary improvements to the product offering to allow full rollout. At the conclusion of the pilots and/or trials when the product offering passes its acceptance tests or defined acceptance criteria the offering is ready for launch/rollout to the market."/>

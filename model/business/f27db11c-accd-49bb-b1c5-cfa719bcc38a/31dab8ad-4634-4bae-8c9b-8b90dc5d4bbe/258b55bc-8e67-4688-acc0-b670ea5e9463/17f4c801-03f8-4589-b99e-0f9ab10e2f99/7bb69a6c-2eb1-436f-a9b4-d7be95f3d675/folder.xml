    documentation="Brief Description&#xA;Manage the lifecycle of standard pricing, policy-based pricing, algorithmic pricing, and feature/property-based pricing associated with product offering.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Product Offering Pricing  manages all aspects of pricing for product offerings.  This includes standard pricing, policy-based pricing, algorithmic pricing, and feature/property-based pricing. Standard pricing processes set the price, develop pricing plans, update prices, obtain approval for pricing, provide notifications of price changes, and remove prices. &#xA;&#xA;The other types of prices define various forms of rules that determine what price should be used under certain conditions.  For example, policy-based pricing may determine if a customer qualifies for a discount based on what product offerings are ordered, algorithmic pricing defines matrices of properties/features used to determine a price, feature/property-based pricing determines a price based on the selection of one or more properties or features by a customer."/>

    documentation="Brief Description&#xA;Develop a specification (definition) of a catalog containing product offerings, develop a product offering catalog, and exchange a catalog among parties.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Product Offering Cataloging develops a specification (definition) for a catalog containing product offerings, develops a product offering catalog, and exchanges a catalog among parties.&#xA;&#xA;Product catalog specifications define reusable definitions for one or more catalogs.  For example, a catalog specification that defines a catalog of smart home devices that is updated with new devices periodically and issued as a new catalog.&#xA;&#xA;Product catalogs can be exchanged by sending a catalog to another party and receiving a catalog from another party.  The receiving party could be a prospect, a customer, or another enterprise that may become a business partner that makes an enterprise's offerings available to the market Similarly a catalog received from another party may be a prelude to the possible on-boarding of the parties offerings.&#xA;&#xA;Note that this process reuses a set of generalized cataloging processes that can also be used to develop service catalogs and resource catalogs."/>

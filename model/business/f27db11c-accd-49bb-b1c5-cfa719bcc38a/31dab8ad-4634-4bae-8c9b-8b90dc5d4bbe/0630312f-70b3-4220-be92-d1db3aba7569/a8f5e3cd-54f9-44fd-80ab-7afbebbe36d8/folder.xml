Note that a purchase may be made from another enterprise. Involvement may include the party account responsible for paying for the purchase and other charges, the party primarily responsible for the product, as well as users of the product. &#xA;&#xA;Updates may include adding new products to a bundle as well as the location of the product. A product may be removed by such scenarios as when the primary party cancels its subscription to the product or when a party browsing the catalog discards the product in which interest was expressed."/>

    documentation="Process Context&#xA;This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modeled in business process terms, and can be applied (ie â€œinstantiated&quot;) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.&#xA;Brief Description&#xA;Restore the service to a normal operational state as efficiently as possible&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;The objective of the Correct &amp; Resolve Service Problem processes is to restore the service to a normal operational state as efficiently as possible.&#xA;Based on the nature of the service failure leading to the associated service alarm event notification, automatic restoration procedures might be triggered.  Manual restoration activity is assigned to the Correct &amp; Resolve Service Problem processes from the Track &amp; Manage Service Problem processes.&#xA;Depending on the nature of the specific service failure, these processes may possibly re-assign services or re-configure service parameters.&#xA;For large service failures requiring extensive re-assignment and/or re-configuration activity to restore normal operation, these processes will attempt to implement work-arounds to recover the specific service operation.  In these circumstances, recovery of normal operation may require invocation of the Support Service Problem Management processes.&#xA;They will also report successful restoration of normal service operation, restoration through temporary work-arounds or an unsuccessful attempt at service restoration to Track &amp; Manage Service Problem through updates to the associated service trouble report.&#xA;Explanatory&#xA;Reserved for future use.&#xA;"/>

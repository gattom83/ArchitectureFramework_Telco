    documentation="Process Context&#xA;This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modeled in business process terms, and can be applied (ie â€œinstantiated&quot;) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.&#xA;Brief Description&#xA;This process passes information about specific service failures due to performance quality threshold violations to Service Problem Management to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process.  It passes information about potential specific customer SLA/QoS performance degradations arising from specific service quality performance degradations (using knowledge about service to purchased &#xA;product offering linkages) to Problem Handling to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process.  It forwards service performance degradation notifications to other Service Quality Management processes, which manage activities to restore normal specific service performance quality.&#xA;&#xA;Perform automated service testing using simulated calls simulating standard user behavior, collect data related to service usage&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;Not used for this process element&#xA;Explanatory&#xA;This process passes information about specific service failures due to performance quality threshold violations to Service Problem Management to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process.&#xA;Mandatory&#xA;passes information about potential specific customer SLA/QoS performance degradations arising from specific service quality performance degradations (using knowledge about service to purchased product offering linkages) to Problem Handling to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process.

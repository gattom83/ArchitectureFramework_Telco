    documentation="Process Context&#xA;This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modeled in business process terms, and can be applied (ie â€œinstantiated&quot;) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.&#xA;Brief Description&#xA;Define the principles, policies and performance standards for the operational organization providing service support&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;The Define Service Support Strategies processes define the principles, policies and performance standards for the operational organization providing service support. Over time, the requirements for service levels and service quality on existing services, and the challenges introduced by new services require changes to the support requirements. These processes define the targets, and operational requirements, in this changing environment. The required performance standards are driven by community expectations, internal process and technology capabilities and competitive offerings. A major input to these processes arises from the Gather &amp; Analyze Service Information processes, and from the product portfolio, resource strategy and market strategy processes. These processes also provide the feedback point from analyses undertaken in the Service Management &amp; Operations process to determine bottlenecks and problems associated with existing service support activities."/>

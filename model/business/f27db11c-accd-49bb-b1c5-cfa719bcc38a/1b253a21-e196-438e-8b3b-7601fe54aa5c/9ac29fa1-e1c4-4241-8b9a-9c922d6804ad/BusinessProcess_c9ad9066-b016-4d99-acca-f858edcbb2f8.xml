    documentation="Process Context&#xA;This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modeled in business process terms, and can be applied (ie â€œinstantiated&quot;) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.&#xA;Brief Description&#xA;Applies discounts  to product prices.&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;This process applies discounts to product prices at an individual product level.  A discount may be expressed as a monetary amount or percentage, and modifies a price for a product.  When a discount is expressed as a percentage, the discounting process determines the discount calculated in relation to the price for the product.&#xA;  &#xA;The discount may be displayed as a separate entry on the bill or may be combined with the rate for the product to only show as one entry.&#xA;  &#xA;Discounts may be a one-time event or may have some duration (days, months, life of product, etc.).    Discounts may apply to a specific customer or be generally available based on selection of products (for example - bundles).  Discounting structures may involve tiers, tapers, or thresholds.&#xA;Explanatory&#xA;Reserved for future use.&#xA;Mandatory&#xA;Reserved for future use.&#xA;Optional&#xA;Reserved for future use.&#xA;"/>

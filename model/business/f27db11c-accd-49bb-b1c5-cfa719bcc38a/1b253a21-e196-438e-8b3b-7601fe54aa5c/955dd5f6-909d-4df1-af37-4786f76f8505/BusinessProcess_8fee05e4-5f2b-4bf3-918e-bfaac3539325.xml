    documentation="Process Context&#xA;This process element represents part of the overall enterprise, modelled in business process terms, and can be applied (i.e. â€œinstantiated&quot;) with other similar process elements for application within a specific organization or domain.&#xA;Brief Description&#xA;Manage termination as appropriate&#xA;Extended Description&#xA;The customer relationship is terminated only if actually appropriate, the wishes of the customer are complied with where possible, records are kept in case the relationship with the customer is re-established, legal and ethical requirements for customer information are complied with. Significant customer life-stage events or business decisions by the Service Provider cause one or both parties to terminate the relationship. The need for complete termination of relationships needs to be differentiated from just terminating all services. The principles behind this include the Service Provider ending a relationship only if the customer ceases to exist, or the customer is fraudulent, the Enterprise decides that it no longer wishes to do business with the customer. All relevant parties are informed of the ended relationship. Other processes are triggered to dismantle the customer solution and servicing arrangements as necessary."/>

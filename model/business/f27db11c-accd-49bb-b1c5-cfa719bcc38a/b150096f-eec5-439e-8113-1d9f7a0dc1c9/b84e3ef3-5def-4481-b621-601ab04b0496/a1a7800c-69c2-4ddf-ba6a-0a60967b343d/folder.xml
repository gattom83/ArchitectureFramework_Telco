The processes define proposals to change existing sales processes and/or channels, or to develop new sales processes and/or channels. These processes undertake the necessary identification of the needs of products, and an analysis of the existing or proposed enterprise sales process and/or channel capabilities. Depending on the proposal a business case process may be required to gain the necessary approval. &#xA;The proposals can be based on industry analysis from the Monitoring Sales &amp; Channel Best Practice processes, on feedback of the effectiveness of existing sales channels from the Selling processes, or on specific requirements associated with the development of new or enhanced products. &#xA;These processes include defining product sales targets for each channel, as well as sales and sales personnel performance indicators for each channel."/>

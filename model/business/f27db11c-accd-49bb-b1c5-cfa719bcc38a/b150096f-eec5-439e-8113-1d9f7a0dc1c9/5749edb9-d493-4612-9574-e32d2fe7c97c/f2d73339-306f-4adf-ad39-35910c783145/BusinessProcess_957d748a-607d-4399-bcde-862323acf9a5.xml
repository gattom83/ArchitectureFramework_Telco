In most standard offerings the necessary sales prospect data is often captured by Contact/Lead/Prospect Management. For non-standard and/or complex sales agreements associated, for instance, with a customer RFP, extensive customer information may be required to plan and roll-out the agreed solution.  For example, a smart city may require extensive capture of details surrounding deployment of IoT devices and applications to manage them."/>

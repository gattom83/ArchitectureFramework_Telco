    documentation="A CustomerAccount may be written off for two main reasons: &#xA;      • When the dunning procedures failed to recover the debt, the bad debt must be written off and reported as such to the General Ledger &#xA;      • When a contract terminates with a “minimal” credit or debit balance (smaller than a threshold reflecting the cost of the collection process). &#xA;The DunningWriteOff corresponds, in a dunning context, to a credit to definitively balance the CustomerAccount before being able to close it."/>

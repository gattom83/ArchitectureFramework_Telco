    documentation="&quot;The SubNetwork class is derived from MTNM; please note that this definition is subtlely different than that of G.805. DEN-ng has mapped this definition into a form that can be represented using the SID and DEN-ng modeling philosophy. By including this mapping in the Network fragment and adding some additional semantics, objects defined in the TMF and ITU are able to interact with objects defined in the IETF.&#xA;&#xA;MTNM defines a subnetwork as an abstraction provided by the EMS to the NMS that describes the potential for subnetwork connections. (An MTNM SubNetworkConnection relates end-point TerminationPoints. It provides a transparent end-to-end connection or a trail (closed or half-open) through a Subnetwork according to the roles associated to its end points.)&#xA;&#xA;DEN-ng uses the above MTNM definition and expands on it. It defines a SubNetwork as existing within a single layer network. It is defined by the set of ResourcePorts that are available for the purpose of transferring characteristic information. The associations between the ResourcePorts at the edge of a SubNetwork may be made and broken by a LayerNetwork management process, thus changing its connectivity. When a SubNetwork connection is established, the reference points are also created by binding the ports to input and output of the SubNetwork connection. In general, SubNetworks may be partitioned into smaller SubNetworks interconnected by links.&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="&quot;This is an abstract base class for representing logical concepts and services that can be managed that are associated with the device as a whole. This class represents a convenient aggregation point for combining different aspects of a device (e.g., software contained in the device, protocols that the devices runs, the set of services that it offers, and so forth). It also enables the device itself to have a single logical manifestation.&#xA;&#xA;Conceptually, this represents the &quot;&quot;brains&quot;&quot; of the Device. For example, it represents the set of entities required for a Router to know how to route packets.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Resource model for more details.&#xA;&quot;"/>

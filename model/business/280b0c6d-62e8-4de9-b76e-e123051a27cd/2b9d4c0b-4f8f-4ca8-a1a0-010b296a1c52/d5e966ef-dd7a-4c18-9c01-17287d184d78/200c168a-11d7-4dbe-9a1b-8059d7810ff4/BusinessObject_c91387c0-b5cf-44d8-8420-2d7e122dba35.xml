    documentation="&quot;This class defines the semantics of the ResourceRolesManagedByPartyRole association.&#xA;&#xA;The ResourceRolesManagedByPartyRole association defines the set of ResourceRoles that are managed by a particular PartyRole. Oftentimes, there are important functional differences between different types of Resources that require very different skill sets, methods, and so forth to be used by the PartyRole that is managing that Resource. For example, different management personnel may be assigned to manage core routers compared to edge routers. This applies not just to the router as a whole, but to its physical (e.g., line cards) and logical (e.g., DeviceInterfaces) components as well. This class captures these semantics.&#xA;&quot;"/>

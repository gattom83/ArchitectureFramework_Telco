    documentation="This is an abstract class that serves as the superclass for all physical interfaces (physical in the sense that they are real interfaces that can be instantiated - they are still logical entities) whose functionality is dependent on a particular transmission medium (e.g., Ethernet vs. ATM). It serves as a convenient aggregation point for running different relationships that affect its subclasses, thereby avoiding having to instantiate multiple relationships that are essentially the same."/>

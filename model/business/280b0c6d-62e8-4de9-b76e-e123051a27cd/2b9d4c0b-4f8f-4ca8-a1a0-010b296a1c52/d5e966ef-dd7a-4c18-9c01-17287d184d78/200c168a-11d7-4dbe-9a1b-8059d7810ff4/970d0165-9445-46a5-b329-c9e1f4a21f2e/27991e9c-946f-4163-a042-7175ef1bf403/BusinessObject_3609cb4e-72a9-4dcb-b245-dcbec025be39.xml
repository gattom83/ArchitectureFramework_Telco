    documentation="&quot;SoftwareFeatureSets describe the groups of SoftwareCommands that distinguish a particular release of Software. The SoftwareCommands contained in the SoftwareFeatureSets are programmable by a particular PartyRole (e.g., a Developer, or NetworkOperator, and in rare cases and EndUser).&#xA;&#xA;Often, SoftwareFeatureSets are used by the manufacturer to define a custom or semi-custom build of software, or are provided as a set of options that are orderable by the Customer.&#xA;&#xA;This should not be confused with Capabilities. Capabilities define what features and functions are available at a given moment for the Resource. Thus, SoftwareFeatureSets represent groups of commands that are available in a device, whereas Capabilities represent higher-level generic functions available in a Resource. For exampe, the ability to perform BGP routing is a Capability, whereas the actual commands used to implement BGP routing are SoftwareCommands that reside in one or more SoftwareFeatureSets. Hence, SoftwareFeatureSets may or may not offer BGP as a programmable feature.&#xA;&quot;"/>

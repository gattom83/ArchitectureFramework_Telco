    documentation="&quot;This is an abstract base class that represents managed entities, such as power supplies, fans and cables, wihch are required for the proper operation of the Device but have a primary function that is different than the primary end-user function(s) of the Device.&#xA;&#xA;The difference between AuxiliaryComponents and other subclasses of Equipment are whether or not the physical object performs a function intrinsic to the main function of the Device. This is best understood by way of example. Consider a Router. Its main function is to route and forward packets. A PowerSupply is an AuxiliaryComponent, because even though it is needed for the proper operation of the Router, it does not directly help in routing and forwarding packets. A LineCard (that provides routing functionality) is a subclass of Equipment because its purpose is to route and forward packets. Similar examples exist for different types of equipment, where their criteria may be different. For example, instead of whether it routes or forwards packets, the criterion &quot;&quot;does it carry signal&quot;&quot; may be useful to appropriately classify components.&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="This is an abstract base class that defines the different types of physical roles that a PhysicalDevice can take on. This enables us to correlate different logical roles to physical hardware. For example, the logical capability of encryption may need dedicated physical hardware. The PhysicalDeviceRole Encryption enables us to model this dependency."/>

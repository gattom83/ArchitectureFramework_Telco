    documentation="A ResourceElement is an entity that is individually manageable. It is an aggregate entity consisting of both physical and logical aspects of a managed resource. For example, a Router is a ResourceElement. Different PhysicalResource objects can model the physical aspects of the Router in detail (e.g., its Cards, the number and type of PhysicalPorts that are on each Card, and so forth), and different LogicalResource objects can model the logical aspects of the Router in detail (e.g., what Software it is running, how many DeviceInterfaces of what type are currently enabled, if there are any outstanding Faults or Alarms, and so forth). ReourceElement aggregates all PhysicalResource and LogicalResource objects, enabling a high-level view of the physical and logical aspects of the Resource to be provided."/>

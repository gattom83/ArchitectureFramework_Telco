    documentation="This is a concrete base class for all LogicalDeviceRoleSpecification subclasses. It exists to enable relationships to be defined between it and other classes in the DEN-ng core model. This helps prevent relationship explosion. It is used to define the invariant attributes, methods, relationships, and constraints of various types of roles associated with LogicalDevices in the DEN-ng model."/>

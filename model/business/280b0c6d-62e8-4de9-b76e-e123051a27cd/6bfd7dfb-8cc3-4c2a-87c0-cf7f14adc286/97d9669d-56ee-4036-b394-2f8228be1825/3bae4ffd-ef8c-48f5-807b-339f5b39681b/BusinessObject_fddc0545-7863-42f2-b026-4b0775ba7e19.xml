    documentation="SCRUM_WorkingIncrement is a special type of ProjectDeliverable in SCRUM projects. It is delivered by SCRUM_Team(s) as the outcome of the processing of SCRUM_BacklogItems in a SCRUM_Sprint. SCRUM_WorkingIncrements do not depend on future ProjectDeliverables. Therefore they are either usable stand-alone providing a new service/ product/ ressource or enhancing an existing one. The SCRUM_WorkingIncrement is presented to the ProjectCustomer at the sprint review meeting held at the end of a SCRUM_Sprint."/>

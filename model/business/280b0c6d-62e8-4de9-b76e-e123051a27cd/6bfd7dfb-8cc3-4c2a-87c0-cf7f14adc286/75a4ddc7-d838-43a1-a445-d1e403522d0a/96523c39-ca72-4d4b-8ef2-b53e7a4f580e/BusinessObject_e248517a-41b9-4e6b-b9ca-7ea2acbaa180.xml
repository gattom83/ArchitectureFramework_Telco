    documentation="&quot;This is a concrete base class for realizing the &quot;&quot;event-condition-passaction-failaction&quot;&quot; semantics that form a DEN-ng policy rule. The semantics of this rule are that the rule is evaluated when an event occurs. If the condition clause is satisfied, then the pass-action clause will be executed (otherwise, the fail-action clause will be executed).&#xA;&#xA;PolicyRules may be nested within PolicyRules. This is often needed in networking (e.g., bandwidth allocation).&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="&quot;The PolicyActionComposite class is the base class for serving as a generic container in which to place PolicyActionAtomic, PolicyActionVendor, or PolicyActionComposite classes. The first two provide actions that this container groups, while the latter establishes a hierarchy in which to order the execution of PolicyActions.&#xA;&#xA;Both simple as well as complex PolicyActions can be placed in this container.&#xA;&#xA;Each PolicyActionAtomic and PolicyActionVendor object is linked to this object using the containedPolicyActions association.&#xA;&quot;"/>

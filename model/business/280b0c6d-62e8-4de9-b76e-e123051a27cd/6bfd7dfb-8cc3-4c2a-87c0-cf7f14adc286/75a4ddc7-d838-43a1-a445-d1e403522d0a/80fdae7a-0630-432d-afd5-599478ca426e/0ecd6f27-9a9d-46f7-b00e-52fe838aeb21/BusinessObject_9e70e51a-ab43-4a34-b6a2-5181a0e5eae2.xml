    documentation="&quot;This class models the triplet {variable, operator, value} that is used by both the PolicyCondition and PolicyAction classes. Note that the semantics are reflected in the types of operators that are allowed to be used in each case.&#xA;&#xA;For conditions, we want the semantics of &quot;&quot;variable relates to value&quot;&quot;, where &quot;&quot;relates to&quot;&quot; is usually the match operator, but could also be other applicable operators (e.g., a comparison operator).&#xA;&#xA;For actions, we want the semantics of &quot;&quot;set variable to value&quot;&quot;. Here, the only operator allowed is the set operator.&#xA;&#xA;Both of these semantics are enforced using OCL.&#xA;&#xA;The ability to use the same basic form for writing PolicyConditions and PolicyActions greatly simplifies the design and implementation of a policy management system by enabling such statements to be automatically generated.&#xA;&quot;"/>

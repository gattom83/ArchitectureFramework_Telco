    documentation="&quot;This class is used to define a list of MAC addresses and MAC address range values as an unordered list of strings, each specifying a MAC address or a range of MAC addresses according to the canonical 802 MAC address format. Each string entry is either:&#xA;&#xA; - a single MAC address, such as 0000:00A5:0000&#xA; - a range of MAC addresses specified by an address&#xA; and mask, such as 0000:00A5:0000,FFFF:FFFF:0000,&#xA; which defines a range of MAC addresses in which the &#xA; first four octets are equal to 0000:00A5.&#xA;&quot;"/>

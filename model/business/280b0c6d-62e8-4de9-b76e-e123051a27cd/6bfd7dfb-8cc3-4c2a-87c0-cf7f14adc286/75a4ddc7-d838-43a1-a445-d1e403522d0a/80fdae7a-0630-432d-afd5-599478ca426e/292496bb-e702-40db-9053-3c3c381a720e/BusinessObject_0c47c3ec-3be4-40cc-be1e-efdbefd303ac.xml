    documentation="&quot;This class is used to provide an unordered list of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, ranges of IPv4 addresses, ranges of IPv6 addresses, and hostnames to be matched against in a policy condition. The format of each string is specified according to the ABNF definition of an IPv4 address.&#xA;&#xA;If a hostname is matched against another valid IP address, the match is done by resolving the hostname into&#xA;a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. Matching hostnames against each other, like matching IP addresses (of the same type) against each other, is done using a string comparison. Matching an IPv4 address against an IPv6 address fails.&#xA;&quot;"/>

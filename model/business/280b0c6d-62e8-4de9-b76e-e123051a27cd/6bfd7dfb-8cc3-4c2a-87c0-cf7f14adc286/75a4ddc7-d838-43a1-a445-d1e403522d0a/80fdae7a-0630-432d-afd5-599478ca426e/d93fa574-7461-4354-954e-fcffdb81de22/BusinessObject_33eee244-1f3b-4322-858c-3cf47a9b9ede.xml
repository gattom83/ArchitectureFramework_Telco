    documentation="This is a concrete class that provides the capability of enabling or disabling a PolicyCondition according to a pre-determined time schedule. This enables this class to effectively enable or disable evaluation of the entire condition clause. The simplest way to do this is to specify a value for the TimePeriod class attribute; this may of course be modified by other class attributes as necessary."/>

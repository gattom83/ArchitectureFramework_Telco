    documentation="&quot;A ManagementDomain class represents a special grouping of ManagedEntities that has two important properties. First, it is used to partition managed objects into a meaningful logical grouping. One important use of such a grouping is to provide a means to define which EMS (as well as which NMS) manages, monitors, etc. which set of devices. It also provides a means to show how management functions are distributed and scaled.&#xA;&#xA;Second, it defines a common administrative domain that is used to administer the managed objects that it contains. This implies that all of the managed objects contained in this ManagementDomain are administered similarly - either by the same user, group of users or policy.&#xA;&quot;"/>

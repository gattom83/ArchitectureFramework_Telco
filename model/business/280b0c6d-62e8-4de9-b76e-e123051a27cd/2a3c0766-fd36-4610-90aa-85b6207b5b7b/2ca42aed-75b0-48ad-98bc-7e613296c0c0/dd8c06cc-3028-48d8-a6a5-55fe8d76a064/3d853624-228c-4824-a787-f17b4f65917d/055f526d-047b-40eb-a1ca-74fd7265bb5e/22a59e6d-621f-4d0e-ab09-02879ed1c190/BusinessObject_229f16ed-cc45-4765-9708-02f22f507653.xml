    documentation="This is a popular type of Scheduler, mainly because it is relatively easy to implement in hardware. Basically, it serves each active Queue, one after another. A Queue is defined to be active if it has any packets that are enqueued.&#xA;&#xA;This scheduler provides fair distribution for packets that are fixed-size. However, it doesn't provide fair behavior if there are variable-size packets."/>

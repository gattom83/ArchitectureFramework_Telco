This enables different Queue instances to be treated as a single atomic QueuingService.This association defines the set of Queues that make up a QueueService. Note that for complicated mechanisms, different types of Queues (e.g., Priority and CBWFQ) can be combined to form a higher-level Queue Service.&#xA;&#xA;The semantics of this class are implemented by the RelatedQueueDetails association class."/>

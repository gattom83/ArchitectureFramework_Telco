    documentation="This class represents a generic specification for defining the different types of Sub-Services that are required to implement a specific type of QoS. This enables business rules to be mapped to the network, and define services that the network provides.&#xA;&#xA;A QoSService can be thought of as an aggregation of sub-services needed to realize the functionality specified by, for example, a ServiceBundle object. This enables the network administrator to map business rules (as specified in a more abstract object or set of objects) to the network, and the network designer to engineer the network such that it can provide different functions for different types of applications.&#xA;&#xA;QoSServices are a type of ResourceFacingService, and are bundled together using ServiceBundles. They can be templatized using ServiceBundleSpecs.&#xA;&#xA;The QoSService itself is a means to coordinate different technology-specific approaches to implementing QoS, such as DiffServ, ToS, and IEEE 802.x. As such, it is an abstract class.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service model for more details."/>

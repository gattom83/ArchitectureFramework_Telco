    documentation="This is an abstract base class that is the parent for different types of traffic conditioning services defined in the DEN-ng Service model. TrafficConditioningServices are one example of a ResourceFacingService, in that the Customer is not able to control them. In fact, the Customer is not even aware that they are there. However, they must be implemented in order for different CoSs to be differentiated from each other, and hence for different Customers to receive different CoSs.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service model for more details.&#xA;"/>

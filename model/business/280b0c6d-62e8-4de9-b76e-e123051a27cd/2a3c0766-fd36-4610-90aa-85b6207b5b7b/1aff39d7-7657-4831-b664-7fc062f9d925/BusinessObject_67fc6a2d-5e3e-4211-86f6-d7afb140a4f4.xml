    documentation="The ServiceSpecificationType class defines a generic category of ServiceSpecifications. Each ServiceSpecificationType serves to group a set of particular ServiceSpecifications that share the same behavior and other semantics. One result of this is to be able to more efficiently define a set of related Services that can be grouped together to form a higher-level Service. For example, a given higher-level Service might include VPN and QoS Services. If these Services are always used together, then they can be categorized using a common type.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service model for more details.&#xA;"/>

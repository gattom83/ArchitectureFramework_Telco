    documentation="&quot;This is a concrete class for describing specific attributes, behavior, relationships, constraints, and semantics for building PhysicalResource objects. The purpose of this class is to be able to track PhysicalResourceSpecifications separately from other types of ResourceSpecifications. Note that this class inherits the modifiesResourceSpec aggregation, and therefore can be used with the corresponding PhysicalResourceSpecification class.&#xA;&#xA;The difference between this class and the PhysicalResourceSpecAtomic class is that this class represents a hierarchy of PhysicalResourceSpecifications. The PhysicalResourceSpecAtomic class represents a single stand-alone PhysicalResourceSpecification.&#xA;&quot;"/>

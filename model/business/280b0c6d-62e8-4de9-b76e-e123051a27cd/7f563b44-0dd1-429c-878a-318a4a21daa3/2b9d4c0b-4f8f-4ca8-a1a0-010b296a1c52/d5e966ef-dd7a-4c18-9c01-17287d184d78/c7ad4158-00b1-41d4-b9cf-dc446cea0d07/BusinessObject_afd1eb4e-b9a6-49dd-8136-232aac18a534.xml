    documentation="This is the abstract base class for all composite entities that are inherently manageable and make up a Product. The key difference between Resource and CompoundResource is that Resource describes either a Physical or a Logical entity (through its PhysicalResource and LogicalResource hierarchies). In contrast, CompoundResource is used to describe managed entities that are collections of other managed entities. A key point is that each managed entity that is part of a CompoundResource can be individually managed as either a PhysicalResource or a LogicalResource."/>

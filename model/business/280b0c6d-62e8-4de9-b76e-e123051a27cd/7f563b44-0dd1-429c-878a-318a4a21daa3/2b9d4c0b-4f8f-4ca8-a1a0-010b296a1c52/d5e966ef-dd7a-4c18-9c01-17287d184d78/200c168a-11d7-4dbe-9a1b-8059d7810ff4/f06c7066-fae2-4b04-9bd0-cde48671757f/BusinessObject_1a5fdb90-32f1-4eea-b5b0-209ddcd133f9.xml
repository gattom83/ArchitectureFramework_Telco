    documentation="&quot;The NetworkForwardingDomain (NFD) object class represents the capacity to enable forwarding and potential for forwarding via ForwardingReleationshipEncapsulation (FRE) constructs. The NFD represents the capability to define a route for forwarding across the contained network. &#xA; &#xA;The NFD represents capability for one or more specific layerProtocols where the relevant boundaries for each layerProtocol coincide appropriately &#xA; &#xA;It a grouping of zero or more: &#xA;- TPEs which represent access to the NFD &#xA;- subordinate NFDs which are a partition of its capacity (and hence completely contained) &#xA;- TLs between the grouped subordinate NFDs &#xA; &#xA;The TPEs associated may terminate TopologicalLinks (TLs). NFD instances and TL instances together define the network topology. &#xA; &#xA;New TPEs may be assigned to the NFD and TPEs may be unassigned from the NFD. &#xA; &#xA;Note that the NFD object may be used to represent routing domains or other administrative domains. The domain groupings may be orthogonal. &#xA; &#xA;The top level NFD corresponds to the whole network for the layerProtocols it includes. &#xA;&quot;"/>

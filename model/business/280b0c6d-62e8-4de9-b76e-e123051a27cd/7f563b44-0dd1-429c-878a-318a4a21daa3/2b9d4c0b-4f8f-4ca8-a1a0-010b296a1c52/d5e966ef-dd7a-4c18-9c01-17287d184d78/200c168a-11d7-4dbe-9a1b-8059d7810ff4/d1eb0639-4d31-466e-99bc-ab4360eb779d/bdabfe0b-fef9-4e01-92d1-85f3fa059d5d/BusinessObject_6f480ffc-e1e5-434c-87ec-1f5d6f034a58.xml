    documentation="&quot;This object class represents simply a list of CTPs in the same Managed Element. GroupTerminationPoints (GTPs) can be cross connected. All CTPs in a GTP are either bidirectional or unidirectional. A GTP can serve as an end point as well as an interior point of an SNC. However, a GTP is not a CTP. &#xA;For further information refer to attached supporting document SD1-3_BundledSNC. &#xA;See R_TMF518_NRF_I_0012 and R_TMF518_NRF_I_0013...\SD\SD1-3_BundledSNC.pdf&quot;"/>

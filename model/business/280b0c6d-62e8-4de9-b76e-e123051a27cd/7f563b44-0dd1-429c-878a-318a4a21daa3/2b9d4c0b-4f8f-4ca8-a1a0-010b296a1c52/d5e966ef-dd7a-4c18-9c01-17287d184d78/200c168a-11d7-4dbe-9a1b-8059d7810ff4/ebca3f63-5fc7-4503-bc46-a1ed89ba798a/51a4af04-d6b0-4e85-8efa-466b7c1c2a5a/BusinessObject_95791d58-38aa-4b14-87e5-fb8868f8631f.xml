    documentation="&quot;This is an abstract base class for representing the different types of management methods that can be used to gather a particular type of management information. For example, this enables configuration setting classes to be defined as using CLI, while configuration monitoring classes could be defined as using a different method, such as SNMP.&#xA;&#xA;The design of how management information is obtained uses this class to gather specific type of information, and the ManagementMethodEntity class to obtain the desired data using an appropriate method. This combination of class hierarchies enables different management methods (e.g., CLI vs. SNMP) to be used to gather different types of management data, and is unique to the DEN-ng information model.&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="This is a concrete base class for representing command sets. Each command set can be represented and managed as its own entity, but also contains one or more sub-ordinate commands or command sets. In other words, this entity is not a stand-alone command; rather, it represents an aggregation of commands. Each command within this aggregation can be individually managed."/>

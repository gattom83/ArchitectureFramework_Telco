When extended, the typeOfDependency attribute must be included, since it is a mandatory attribute. However, new values may be added to its enumerated list of values.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Resource model for more details.&#xA;&#xA;This association represents the binding between a PhysicalResource and a LogicalResource.

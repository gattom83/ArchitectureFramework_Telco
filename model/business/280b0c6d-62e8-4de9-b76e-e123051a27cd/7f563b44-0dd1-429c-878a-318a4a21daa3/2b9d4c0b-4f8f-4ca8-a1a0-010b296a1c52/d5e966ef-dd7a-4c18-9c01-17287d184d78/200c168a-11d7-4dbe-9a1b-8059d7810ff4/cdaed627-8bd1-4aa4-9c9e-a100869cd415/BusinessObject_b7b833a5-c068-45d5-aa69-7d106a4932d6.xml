    documentation="&quot;This class is used to represent the semantics of the LogicalDeviceGovernsDeviceInterfaces aggregation.&#xA;&#xA;In general, there are multiple ways to manage a Deviceinterface. The first distinction lies in what is being managed. DEN-ng defines two types of management commands categories: configuration and operational. Configuration commands are used to configure the DeviceInterface (and also the LogicalDevice for commands that affect more than one specific DeviceInterface). Operational commands are used to monitor and troubleshoot the software, network connectivity, and the Device itself.&#xA;This aggregation defines the set of (logical) DeviceInterfaces that are managed by a particular LogicalDevice.&#xA;&#xA;Note the difference between this aggregation and the PPortHasInterfaces aggregation - this aggregation represents administrative management, whereas the former represents physical containment. This flexibility enables complex devices that have multiple LogicalDevices to be modeled, where a particular LogicalDevice can be assigned to manage a given DeviceInterface.&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="This is an abstract class that serves as the superclass for all virtual interfaces. LogicalInterfaces are also called virtual interfaces. This is because a LogicalInterface has no hardware associated with it, and it is not physically connected to a network. It serves as a convenient aggregation point for running different relationships that affect its subclasses, thereby avoiding having to instantiate multiple relationships that are essentially the same."/>

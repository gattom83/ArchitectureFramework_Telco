    documentation="A NetworkDomain represents a set of ManagedPhysicalEntities that share a common set of administrative and operational characteristics. Primary among these is the use of a common naming methodology. A NetworkDomain is used to partition ManagedEntity instances into logical groupings (e.g., operational and/or administrative groups) that are controlled by one or more common managers. NetworkDomains provide one way to administer and control the operational characteristics of a set of ManagedEntities."/>

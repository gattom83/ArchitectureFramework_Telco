    documentation="&quot;The Resource ABE contains entities that are used to represent the various aspects of a Resource. These can be divided into four basic types of entities.&#xA;&#xA;The first two, PhysicalResource and LogicalResource, are sets of entities that represent the physical and logical aspects of a Resource, respectively. This is important to enable the SID to build a set of reusable managed entities that can be used to model the physical and logical aspects of different types of Resources.&#xA;&#xA;The third type of entity, CompoundResource, is a set of entities that shows how to aggregate PhysicalResources and LogicalResources into aggregate entities that has physical and logical characteristics and behavior. This enables designers to represent Resources that have physical and logical characteristics and behavior as a single entity.&#xA;&#xA;The fourth type of entity, Network, is a set of entities that shows how to represent networks, sub-networks, network components, and other related aspects of a network. This type of entity builds on the notion of a CompoundResource by aggregating CompoundResources into a functional whole.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="&quot;An Autonomous System (AS) provides a structured view of routing by segregating the system that is using routing (e.g., the Internet, a corporate intranet, or a company extranet) into a set of separately administered domains that each has their own independent routing policies.&#xA;&#xA;The classic definition of an AS, from RFC1771, is '...a set of routers under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to other ASs. Since this classic definition was developed, it has become common for a single AS to use several interior gateway protocols and sometimes several sets of metrics within an AS. The use of the term Autonomous System here stresses the fact that, even when multiple IGPs and metrics are used, the administration of an AS appears to other ASs to have a single coherent interior routing plan and presents a consistent picture of what destinations are reachable through it.'&#xA;&quot;"/>

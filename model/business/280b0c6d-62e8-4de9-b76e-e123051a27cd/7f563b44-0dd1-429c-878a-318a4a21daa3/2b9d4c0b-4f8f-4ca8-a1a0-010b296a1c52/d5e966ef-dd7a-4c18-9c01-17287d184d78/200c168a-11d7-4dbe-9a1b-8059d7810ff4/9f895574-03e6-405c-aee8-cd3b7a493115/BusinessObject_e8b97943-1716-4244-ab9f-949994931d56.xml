    documentation="&quot;This is a concrete base class for representing logical concepts and services that can be managed which are associated with the device as a whole. This class represents a convenient aggregation point for combining different aspects of a device (e.g., software contained in the device, protocols that the devices runs, the set of services that it offers, and so forth). It also enables the device itself to have a single logical manifestation.&#xA;&#xA;This class represents all logical devices that are composite in nature (e.g., made up of multiple distinct logical devices that can be separately managed). The composite pattern is used to enable LogicalDeviceComposite objects to be made up of LogicalDevice objects (i.e., either LogicalDeviceAtomic and/or LogicalDeviceComposite objects).&#xA;&quot;"/>

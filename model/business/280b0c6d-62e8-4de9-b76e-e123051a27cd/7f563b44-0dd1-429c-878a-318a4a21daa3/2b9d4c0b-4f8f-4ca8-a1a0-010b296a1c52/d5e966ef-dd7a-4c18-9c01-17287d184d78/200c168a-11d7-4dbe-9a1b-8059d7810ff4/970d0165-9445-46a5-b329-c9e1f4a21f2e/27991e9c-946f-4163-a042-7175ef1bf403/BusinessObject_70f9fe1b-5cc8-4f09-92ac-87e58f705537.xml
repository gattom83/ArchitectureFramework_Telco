    documentation="&quot;This is an abstract class for representing atomic units of Software that are individually manageable and do NOT form composite, or nested, software units. &#xA; &#xA;From a finite state machine view, each SoftwareAtomic element is not just individually manageable, but is also installable, executable, and runnable. In addition, each SoftwareAtomic element can be a FRU. &#xA; &#xA;This is the super-class for creating concrete subclasses that define particular functionality (e.g., a device driver, or software that implements MPLS as part of a larger routing software package). &#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="This is the base class for defining protocols that use a link state routing algorithm. In this algorithm, each router broadcasts or multicasts information regarding the cost of reaching each of its neighbors to all nodes in the internetwork. In other words, each router sends only the portion of its routing table that describes the state of its own link. Link state algorithms enable each router to build a picture of the entire network in its routing table."/>

    documentation="&quot;This class is the base class of the MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) Protocol. Subclasses of the MPLS class are used to configure various aspects of MPLS.&#xA;&#xA;MPLS separates forwarding packets from defining what the label means. The forwarding paradigm used is based on the notion of label swapping. MPLS supports a wide variety of forwarding behavior, ranging from a label being associated to a group of routes to a label being associated to a particular flow.&#xA;&quot;"/>

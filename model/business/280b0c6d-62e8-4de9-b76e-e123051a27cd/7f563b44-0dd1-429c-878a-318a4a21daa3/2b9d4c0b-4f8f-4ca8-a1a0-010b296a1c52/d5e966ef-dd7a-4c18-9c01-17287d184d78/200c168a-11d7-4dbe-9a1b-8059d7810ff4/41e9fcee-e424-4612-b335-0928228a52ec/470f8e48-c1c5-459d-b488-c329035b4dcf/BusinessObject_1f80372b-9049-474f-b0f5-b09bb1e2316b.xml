    documentation="&quot;This is an abstract base class for representing different types of routed protocols that can be managed. Routed protocols are those protocols that can be routed by a router. Specifically, the router must be able to interpret the logical internetwork as specified by that routed protocol. This class represents a convenient aggregation point for defining how routed protocols are managed and used.&#xA;&#xA;The DEN-ng model defines AppleTalk, DecNET, IP, and IPX as examples of subclasses of this class.&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="&quot;This is the base class for different types of PhysicalComponents that can reside either in an Equipment or an EquipmentHolder object. They can NOT be used as a stand-alone object.&#xA;&#xA;From a management point-of-view, this object either can not or does not need to be split into its constituent parts. For example, an ASIC (or Chip) can not , and a tape for data storage does not, need to be split up into their constituent parts. Any piece of hardware that is not a PhysicalLink, PhysicalConnector, Equipment, or EquipmentHolder, is a subclass of this class.&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="This is an abstract base class for representing the different types of roles that various physical resources can take on. For this first iteration, two specialized roles have been defined: holder and adapter. This enables a single object, such as a Card, to have additional functions. For example, a Card may also serve as a motherboard or hosting board for another Card. In this situation, there isn't a separate EquipmentHolder - rather, the Card acts as a holder in addition to providing its normal functions. This class is the base class for defining different types of physical resource roles. Attributes are TBD."/>

    documentation="&quot;This class represents EquipmentHolders that are made up of other EquipmentHolders (i.e., instances of this class as well as the HolderAtomic base class). This provides the semantics of collecting a set of components, each of which is individually manageable, and being able to manage the set of objects as a whole. This containment is modeled using the HasHolders aggregation.&#xA;&#xA;Each HolderComposite element can be a FRU.&#xA;&#xA;A characteristic of this class is that its subclasses are physical objects that have complex cabling and mounting options. This class is meant to differentiate complex holders, like a Chassis, from simple holders, like a Slot.&#xA;&quot;"/>

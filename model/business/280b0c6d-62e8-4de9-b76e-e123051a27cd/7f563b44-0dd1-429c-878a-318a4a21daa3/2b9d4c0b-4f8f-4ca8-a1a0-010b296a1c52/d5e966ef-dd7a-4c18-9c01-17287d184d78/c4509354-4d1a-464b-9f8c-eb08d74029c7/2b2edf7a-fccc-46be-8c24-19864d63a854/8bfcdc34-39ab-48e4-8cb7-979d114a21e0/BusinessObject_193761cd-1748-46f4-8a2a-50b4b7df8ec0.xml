    documentation="&quot;A Rack is a type of SecureHolder that represents an enclosure in which EquipmentHolders, such as Chassis, are placed. Typically a Rack is nothing more than the enclosure, and all the functioning componentry is packaged in the Chassis.&#xA;&#xA;Note that the logical identifier of a Rack is NOT typically associated with the Device (i.e., the NetworkElement). Compare this to either a Bay or a Shelf, whose logical identifier IS associated with the Device. This means that the Rack is explicitly NOT a part of the logical model of a network.&#xA;&#xA;The Rack typically serves as the &quot;&quot;master enclosure&quot;&quot; for Chassis, Shelves and Bays. In addition, Racks can have multiple instances of multiple Devices mounted in them.&#xA;&quot;"/>

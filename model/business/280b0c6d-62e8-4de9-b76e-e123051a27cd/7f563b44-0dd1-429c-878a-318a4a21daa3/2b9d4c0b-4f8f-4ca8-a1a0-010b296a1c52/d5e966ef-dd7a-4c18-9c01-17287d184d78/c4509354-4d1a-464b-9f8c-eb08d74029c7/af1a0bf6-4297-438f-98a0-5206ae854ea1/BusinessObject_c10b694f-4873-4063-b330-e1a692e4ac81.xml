    documentation="&quot;This class is based on the m.3100 specification, and is described as follows:&#xA;&#xA;The Equipment object class is a class of managed objects that represents physical components of a managed device, including replaceable components. An instance of this object class must be present in only a single geographic location. An Equipment object may be nested within another Equipment object, thereby creating a containment relationship. The Equipment type shall be identified by sub-classing this object class. Either the name of the sub-class or an attribute may be used for identifying the equipment type.&#xA;&#xA;Changed name of m.3100 attribute AlarmReportingIndicator to AlarmStatus, and enhanced semantics.&#xA;&#xA;The m.3100 SystemTitle attribute is NOT implemented in this class, we're using CommonName instead.&#xA;&#xA;We don't support the m.3100 supportedByObjectList attribute. This attribute is intended to list a set of physical and logical objects that directly affect this object. We think that the model should show this via associations, not via an embedded attribute.&#xA;&quot;"/>

A Configuration may contain one or more parts (which is realized by using the Atomic/Composite pattern, but it is represented as a single entity - ConfigurationRelationship), and each part may contain zero or more fields. Each field may have attributes that are statically or dynamically defined. Some of these fields have fixed values, while others provide values from which a choice or choices can be made (e.g., using the EntitySpec/Entity and/or CharacteristicSpec/CharacteristicValue patterns)."/>

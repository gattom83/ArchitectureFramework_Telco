    documentation="&quot;This is an abstract base class that represents how to form the action clause of a PolicyRule. This consists of a single occurrence of a PolicyStatement, which is of the form:&#xA;&#xA; {variable, operator, value}&#xA;&#xA;Policy actions have the semantics of &quot;&quot;SET variable to value&quot;&quot;. There are two types of actions:&#xA;&#xA; - pass actions are invoked if the condition clause was TRUE&#xA; - fail actions are invoked if the condition clause was FALSE&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="&quot;This is a class that implements the semantics needed for the containedPolicyActions aggregation.This aggregation is used for two distinct purposes. First, it is used to gather together discrete PolicyActions to form a PolicyAction clause. In this usage, the set of individual PolicyActionAtomic objects are aggregated by a PolicyActionComposite object.&#xA;&#xA;The second use is to form compound PolicyActions. In this case, the PolicyActionAtomic object aggregates PolicyActionAtomic and/or PolicyActionComposite objects. The former provides a simple nested PolicyAction, while the latter provides structure for grouping the sub-actions that are dependent on a higher-level action.&#xA;&quot;"/>

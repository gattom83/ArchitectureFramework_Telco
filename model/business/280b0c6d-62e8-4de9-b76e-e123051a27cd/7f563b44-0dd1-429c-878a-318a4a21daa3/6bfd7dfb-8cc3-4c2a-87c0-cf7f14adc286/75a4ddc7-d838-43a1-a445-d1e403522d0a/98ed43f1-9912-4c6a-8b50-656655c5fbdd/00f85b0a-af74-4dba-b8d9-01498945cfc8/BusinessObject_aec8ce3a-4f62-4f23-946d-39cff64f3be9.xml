    documentation="&quot;This is a concrete base class that defines the concept of various types of roles used to describe PolicyBrokers and their use in the DEN-ng model.&#xA;&#xA;A PolicyBrokerRole refines the generic concepts of a PolicyApplicationRole. Specifically, this base class is used to describe generic functionality inherent in a PolicyBroker. For example, this includes the ability to present and negotiate functionality that is traded between different PolicyServers in different PolicyDomains, as well as the ability to control the functions of a PolicyServer.&#xA;&#xA;More detail will be provided in the next release of the DEN-ng model.&#xA;&quot;"/>

    documentation="&quot;A PolicyServer is a fundamental building block of a policy-based management system. It represents both a set of core functionality for implementing policy as well as a unit of distribution in a distributed implementation.&#xA;&#xA;With respect to functionality, a PolicyServer is an entity that is either manufactured or is constructed by integrating the functionality of different PDPs, PXPs, PEPs, and other applications. These other applications provide the logic to manage and control the set of PDPs, PXPs, and PEPs that constitute a PolicyServer. For example, conflict detection and resolution need to be applied.&#xA;&#xA;Therefore, a PolicyServer is in reality an intelligent container that contains its own management logic that is supplemented by the functionality of the PEP, PXP, and PDP applications. It usually corresponds to a single PolicyDomain. While this is not strictly necessary, doing otherwise greatly complicates the resulting management logic.&#xA;&quot;"/>

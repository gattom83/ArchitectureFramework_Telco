    documentation="&quot;A PolicyEnforcementPoint is a type of PolicyApplication, and is used to verify that a prescribed set of PolicyActions have been successfully executed on a set of PolicyTargets.&#xA; &#xA;A PolicyEnforcementPoint serves as an interface between the devices that policy is executed on and the policy decision-makers (such as the PolicyDecisionPoint) of the policy. PolicyEnforcementPoints request work to be performed from PolicyDecisionPoints, and then enforce decisions made by PolicyExecutionPoints on their PolicyTargets. One or more PolicyEnforcementPoints are contained in a PolicyServer.&#xA;&#xA;The combination of a PolicyExecutionPoint and a PolicyEnforcementPoint enable the act of executing a decision (made by a PolicyExecutionPoint) to be separated from the act of ensuring that the executing actions were performed correctly, and had the desired results (both of these latter two functions are performed by the PolicyEnforcementPoint).&#xA;&quot;"/>

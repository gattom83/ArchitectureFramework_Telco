    documentation="The PolicyEventSpecType class defines a generic category of PolicyEventSpecs. Each PolicyEventSpecType serves to group a set of particular PolicyEventSpecs that share the same behavior and other semantics. One result of this is to be able to more efficiently define a set of related PolicyEventSpecs that can be grouped together to form a higher-level, or composite, PolicyEventSpec."/>

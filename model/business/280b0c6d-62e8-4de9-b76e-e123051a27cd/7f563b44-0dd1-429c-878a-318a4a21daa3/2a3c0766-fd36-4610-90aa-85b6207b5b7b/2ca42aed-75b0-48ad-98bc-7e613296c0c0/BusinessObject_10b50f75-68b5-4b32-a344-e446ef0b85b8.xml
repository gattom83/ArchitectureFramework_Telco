    documentation="This is an associationClass defined in the DEN-ng Service model. It represents the semantics (e.g., exists, uses, and other relationships) that exist when a PhysicalResource is used to help supply or support a particular ResourceFacingService.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service model for more details.&#xA;This aggregation defines the set of PhysicalResources that are required for this particular ResourceFacingService to function correctly. This includes as a minimum the set of PhysicalResources that are required to host this particular ResourceFacingService.&#xA;&#xA;The PhysicalResourcesHostRFS aggregation describes a hosting relationship, which is essentially passive in nature - the PhysicalResources exist so that the LogicalResources can be hosted on it.&#xA;&#xA;The cardinality of the LogicalResourcesImplementRFS and PhysicalResourcesHostRFS aggregations are both 0..n on the aggregate side, because PhysicalResources can be installed which use LogicalResources before a ResourceFacingService is actually implemented. However, a ResourceFacingService can have one or more PhysicalResources for it to be instantiated. Hence, the aggregations has a 1..n cardinality on its component end.&#xA;"/>

    documentation="This is an abstract base class that defines a Service in terms of a set of roles. The roles are then used to characterize the functionality of the Service, regardless of whether it is a resource- or a customer-facing service.&#xA;&#xA;ServiceRoles represent the functionality of a Service, and as such are a mix of the invariant and changeable characteristics and behavior of a Service. Representing a Service in terms of ServiceRoles enables the functionality of the Service to be defined independently of BusinessActor, PhysicalResource, LogicalResource, or other Services.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service model for more details."/>

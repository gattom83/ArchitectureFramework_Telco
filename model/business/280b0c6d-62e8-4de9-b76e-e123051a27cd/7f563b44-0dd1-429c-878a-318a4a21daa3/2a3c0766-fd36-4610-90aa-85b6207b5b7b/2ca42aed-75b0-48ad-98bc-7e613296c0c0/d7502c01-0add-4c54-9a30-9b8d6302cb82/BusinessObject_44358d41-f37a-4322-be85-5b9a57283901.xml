    documentation="A ServicePackage is derived from an associated ServicePackageSpec. The ServicePackageSpec defines the invariant attributes, methods, relationships, and constraints for all ServicePackage instances that are derived from it. This enables each individual ServicePackage to add its own application-specific changeable characteristics and behavior.&#xA;&#xA;Note that there is no specific aggregation used to relate a particular ServicePackage to the ServicePackageSpec that it is derived from. This is because the ServicePackageSpec and ServicePackage both inherit the SpecifiesService aggregation, and at this (the business level) view, there are no new semantics that are required to represent this relationship.&#xA;&#xA;Finally, while the composite pattern could be applied to ServicePackage, there is no perceived need to do so. Multiple ServicePackages will simply be aggregated by a ProductBundle, and appear as separate ProductComponents.&#xA;"/>

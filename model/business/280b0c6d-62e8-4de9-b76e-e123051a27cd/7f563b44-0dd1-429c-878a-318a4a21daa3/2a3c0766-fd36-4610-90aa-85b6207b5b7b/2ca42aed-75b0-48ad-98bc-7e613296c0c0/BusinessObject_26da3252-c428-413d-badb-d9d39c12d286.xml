    documentation="This is an associationClass defined in the DEN-ng Service model. It represents the semantics (e.g., exists, uses, and other relationships) that exist when a LogicalResource is used to help supply or support a particular ResourceFacingService.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service model for more details.&#xA;This aggregation defines the set of LogicalResources that are required for this particular ResourceFacingService to function correctly.&#xA;&#xA;The LogicalResourcesImplementRFS aggregation is active in nature - it signifies an active whole-part relationship between a set of LogicalResources and a ResourceFacingService. Put another way, this latter aggregation is used to identify the LogicalResources that are used so that a ResourceFacingService can function.&#xA;&#xA;The cardinality of the LogicalResourcesImplementRFS aggregation is 0..n on the aggregate side, because PhysicalResources can be installed which use LogicalResources before a ResourceFacingService is actually implemented. AResourceFacingService can have zero or more PhysicalResources and LogicalResources for it to be instantiated. Hence, the aggregations has a 1..n cardinality on its component end."/>

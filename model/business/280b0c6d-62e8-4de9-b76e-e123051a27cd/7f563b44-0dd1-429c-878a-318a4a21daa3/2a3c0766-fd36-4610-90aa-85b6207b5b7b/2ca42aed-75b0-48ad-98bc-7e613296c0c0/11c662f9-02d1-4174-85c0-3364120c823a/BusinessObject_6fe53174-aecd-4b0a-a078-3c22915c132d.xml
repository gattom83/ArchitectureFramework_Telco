    documentation="Conceptually, a ServiceBundle is thought of as a collection of ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications. This enables the needs of different sets of ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications to be grouped together â€“ hence, the name &quot;bundle&quot;. Since these are ResoureFacingSpecifications, they define reusable templates for implementing the ResourceFacingServices that are required by a particular CustomerFacingService (as represented by a ServicePackage).&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;ServiceBundles were designed to define a set of Class of Service specifications that were required by a CustomerFacingService to work together. A ServicePackage is the entity that models the requirements of the CustomerFacingService. Thus, ServicePackages can specify different packaging of CustomerFacingServices that are obtained by a Customer via a Product, and ServiceBundles specify the set of ResourceFacingServices that each CustomerFacingService requires.&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;ServiceBundles are a natural way to implement the requirements of a ServicePackage, and are related to a ServicePackage through the ServicePackageUsesServiceBundles aggregation."/>

    documentation="A Classifier is an internal component of the forwarding path. It is used to recognize and distinguish among different packet streams or flows. Without classification, all packets will be treated the same.&#xA;&#xA;The function of the ClassifierService is to model the identification of traffic accepted at the ingress interface of the device, and to separate traffic into different flows. This enables flows from different applications that can be treated the same way to be aggregated together, making the network design much more scalable.&#xA;&#xA;For almost all situations, the ClassifierService will be followed by a MarkerService (or one of its subclasses) so that separate traffic can be assigned a unique mark in the packet header. This will enable subsequent mechanisms to simply examine the mark in the header and perform operations based on that marking. This dependency is modeled using an instance of the NextForwardingService association.&#xA;&#xA;The definition of which flows can be separated into which aggregates is defined using the TrafficMatchCriteria class.&#xA;&#xA;The Classifier uses the PolicyStatement construct from the Policy Model. Operator is set to &quot;match&quot;. PolicyVariable and PolicyValue can either be predefined in a TrafficMatchCriteria class, or defined dynamically using the four attributes defined in this class.&#xA;&#xA;In DEN-ng, this is modeled as a Service that can be invoked."/>

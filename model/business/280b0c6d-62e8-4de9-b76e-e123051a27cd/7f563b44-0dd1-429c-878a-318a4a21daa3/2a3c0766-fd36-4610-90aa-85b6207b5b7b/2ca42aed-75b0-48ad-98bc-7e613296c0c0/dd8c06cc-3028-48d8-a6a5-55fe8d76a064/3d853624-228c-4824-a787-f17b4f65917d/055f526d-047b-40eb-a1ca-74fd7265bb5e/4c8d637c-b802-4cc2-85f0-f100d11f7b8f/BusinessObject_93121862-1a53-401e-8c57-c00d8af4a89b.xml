    documentation="Queuing can be thought of as the act of delaying of packets inside a device before they are transmitted to the next device. This is often called congestion management in the literature. There are many different algorithms to do this task, each having different purposes, different implementation (and therefore programming) complexities, and different uses. Since the semantics of these algorithms are very different, DEN-ng models each algorithm as a subclass of QueueService.&#xA;&#xA;Queues are not infinite in size, and therefore can fill to capacity. So, what happens when a new packet arrives if the queue is filled? Either the new packet is inserted into the queue, and the existing contents of the queue are dropped, or the new packet is inserted and a packet is removed from the queue to make room for the new packet. The details of how a packet is inserted and removed are examples of the differences in queuing algorithms.&#xA;&#xA;Queuing is designed to accommodate temporary congestion on a network device's interface by storing excess packets in buffers until bandwidth becomes available. This can be used in order to meet the varying bandwidth, jitter, and delay requirements of different applications."/>

    documentation="The programming of a QoSService is represented in DEN-ng as a set of NetworkForwardingServices. This is because when traffic is forwarded, it can be differentiated from other traffic. During the forwarding process, packets can be (for example) queued or dropped. These are two examples of different types of QoS that are grouped into what are called TrafficConditioningServices in DEN-ng.&#xA;&#xA;In order to packets to be identified, they need to be classified and marked. This is, in DEN-ng, termed a TrafficIdentificationService.&#xA;&#xA;Both TrafficIdentificationService and TrafficConditioningService are subclassed from NetworkForwardingService. A TrafficIdentificationService is used to classify and mark packets to separate one traffic flow from another traffic flow. Once this is done, different means of defining how packets are forwarded can be defined, such as queuing and dropping, which are different types of TrafficConditioningServices.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, we see that a given QoSService technology can be programmed using a particular set of NetworkForwardingServices, which is represented in generic fashion by the ForwardingDefinedBy relationship."/>

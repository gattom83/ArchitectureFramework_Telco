    documentation="The REDDropperService represents the ability to drop network traffic using a Random Early Detection (RED) type of algorithm. The purpose of a RED algorithm is to avoid congestion (as opposed to managing congestion). Without RED, when the queue fills up, all packets that arrive are dropped. With RED, as opposed to dropping traffic from a fixed location (e.g., from the head or the tail of the queue), the device monitors the average queue size and uses a random algorithm to drop traffic from a random location.&#xA;&#xA;These discards cause TCP-based applications to slow its transmission rate for those connections that experienced the packet discards. Note that UDP-based applicatons aren't affected; this is why the FlowREDDropper subclass was built.&#xA;&#xA;WRED adds a weighting factor to the RED algorithm to enable traffic with different priorities to have different performance characteristics. This is dictated by associating different drop probabilities with different traffic. A weighted algorithm is identified by having its isWeighted attribute to be TRUE.&#xA;&#xA;For example, traffic with different ToS or DSCP values can have different probabilities of being dropped. The same is true for different types of protocols (e.g., trtaffic using RSVP could be given a smaller drop probability). This means that WRED provides separate thresholds and weights for different traffic, instead of a single threshold and weight like RED does."/>

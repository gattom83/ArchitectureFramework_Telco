    documentation="This is a cross between priority queuing and fair queuing, seeking to garner the best from both algorithms. All queues are serviced so that none are starved, but some queues are serviced more than others. A portion of the bandwidth of a DeviceInterface is allocated to each active flow.&#xA;&#xA;A weight is applied to each queue to give some queues higher priority than other queues. For example, one queue may get half the available bandwidth and other queues will get a varying percentage of the remaining bandwidth. Traffic may be prioritized according to many different mechanisms, such as packet markings, source and destination IP address fields, source and destination port numbers, and so forth.&#xA;&#xA;WFQ weights traffic so that low-bandwidth traffic gets a fair level of priority. If high-priority queues are not in use, lower-priority traffic uses its queues. This prevents high-bandwidth traffic from grabbing an unfair share of resources.A unique feature is that it moves real-time interactive traffic to the front of queues and fairly shares the remaining bandwidth among other flows."/>

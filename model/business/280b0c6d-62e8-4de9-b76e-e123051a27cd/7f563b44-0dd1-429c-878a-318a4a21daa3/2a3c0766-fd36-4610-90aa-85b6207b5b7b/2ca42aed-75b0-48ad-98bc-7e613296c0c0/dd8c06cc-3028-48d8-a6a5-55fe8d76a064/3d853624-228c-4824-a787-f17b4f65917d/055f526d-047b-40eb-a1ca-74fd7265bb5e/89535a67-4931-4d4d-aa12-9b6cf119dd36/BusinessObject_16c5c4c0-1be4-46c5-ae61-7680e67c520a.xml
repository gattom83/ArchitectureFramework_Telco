    documentation="A DropperService is a basic traffic conditioning building block. A DropperService represents the ability to selectively drop network packets or even flows. This is NOT the same as denying the forwarding of a packet or flow; rather, this represents the conscious act to discard a packet (or possibly even a flow). Compound traffic conditioning elements, such as Policers and Shapers, will implicitly use DropperServices.&#xA;&#xA;Droppers are distinguished by the algorithm that they use to drop traffic. The semantics of these algorithms are different enough to warrant their modeling by using subclasses.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the system view of the DEN-ng QoS model for their definition."/>

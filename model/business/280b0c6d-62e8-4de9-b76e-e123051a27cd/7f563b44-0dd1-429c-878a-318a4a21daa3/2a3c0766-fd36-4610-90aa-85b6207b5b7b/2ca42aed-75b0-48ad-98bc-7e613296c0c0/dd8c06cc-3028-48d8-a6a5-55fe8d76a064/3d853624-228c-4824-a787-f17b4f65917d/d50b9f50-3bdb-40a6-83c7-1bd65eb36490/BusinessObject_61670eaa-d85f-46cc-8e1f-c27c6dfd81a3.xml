    documentation="The function of a MarkerService is to mark packets in a flow so that different devices in the network know how to treat the traffic that these packets belong to. This is done by &quot;coloring&quot; a packet so that it can be identified and distinguished among other packets that are receiving traffic conditioning. In effect, this partitions a network into multiple priority levels or classes. Marking packets is done using a technology-specific mechanism, such as the ToS byte, the DSCP, or other methods for other media.&#xA;&#xA;In DEN-ng, this function is modeled by the MarkerService. This service will mark a selected field in a network packet with a specified value. Packets are marked in order to indicate to downstream components what types of TrafficConditioningServices they will subsequently receive.&#xA;&#xA;The definition of how to mark a particular packet is defined using the MarkerPool class.&#xA;&#xA;Note that there is a fundamental difference between its two subclasses. StandardMarkerService enables different types of technology-specific marking, which directly affect subsequent operations, to be defined. Examples of this include the difference between DiffServ marking and IEEE 802 marking. The PreambleMarkingService is used to capture the result of traffic conditioning operations and store them in a preamble. The two types of marking can be combined in some implementations.&#xA;"/>

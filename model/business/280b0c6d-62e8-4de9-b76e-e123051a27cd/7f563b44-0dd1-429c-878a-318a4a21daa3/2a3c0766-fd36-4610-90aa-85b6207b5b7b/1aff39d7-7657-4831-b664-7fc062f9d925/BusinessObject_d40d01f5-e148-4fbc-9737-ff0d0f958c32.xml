    documentation="This is an abstract base class for defining the ServiceSpecification hierarchy. All Services are characterized as either being possibly visible and usable by a Customer or not. This gives rise to the two subclasses of Service: CustomerFacingService and ResourceFacingService. However, each instance of a Service is made up of changeable as well as invariant attributes, methods, relationships and constraints. A ServiceSpecification defines the invariant characteristics of a Service. It can be conceptually thought of as a template that different Service instances can be instantiated from. Each of these Service instances will have the same invariant characteristics. However, the other characteristics of the instantiated Service will be specific to each instance.&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;This class can be thought of as a template, which represents a generic specification for implementing a particular type of Service. A ServiceSpecification may consist of other ServiceSpecifications supplied together as a collection. Members of the collection may be offered individually or collectively. ServiceSpecifications may also exist within groupings, such as within a Product.&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;ServiceSpecification inherits from Specification, which inherits from ManagedEntity."/>

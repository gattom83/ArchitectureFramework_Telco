    documentation="This is an abstract base class that defines an integrated set of ResourceFacingServices that collectively meets the needs of a CustomerFacingService. For example, the Customer may have requested &quot;GoldService&quot;, which is a ServicePackage that defines a set of ServiceBundles, each of which has its own QoS. Each individual ResourceFacingService that is part of the ServicePackage can be derived from a ResourceFacingServiceSpecification. In this case, a ResourceFacingServiceSpecComposite will aggregate all of the individual ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications into a single named object.&#xA;&#xA;This object is a stand-alone object. However, it consists of other ResourceFacingServiceSpecComposite and/or ResourceFacingServiceSpecAtomic entities. That is the primary difference between this entity and the ResourceFacingServiceSpecAtomic entity.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service Model whitepaper for more information and examples."/>

    documentation="This is an abstract base class for defining ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications that do not have any subordinate ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications. In other words, a ResourceFacingServiceSpecAtomic is a stand-alone ResourceFacingServiceSpecification, and doesn't require any supporting ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications to define the invariant characteristics (i.e., non-changing attributes, methods, relationships, and constraints) of any ResourceFacingServices that it serves as a template for.&#xA;&#xA;Please see the DEN-ng Service Model whitepaper for more information and examples."/>

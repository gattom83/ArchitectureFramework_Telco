    documentation="A ServiceBundleSpec is the base class for defining the different classes of bundled ResourceFacingServiceSpecs.&#xA;&#xA;Conceptually, a ServiceBundleSpec is thought of as a collection to enable the needs of different sets of ResourceFacingServiceSpecs to be grouped together. The &quot;bundle&quot; conveys the concept of grouped ServiceSpecs that are related. Since these are ResoureFacingSpecifications, they define reusable templates for implementing the ResourceFacingServices that are required by a particular CustomerFacingService (as represented by a ServicePackage).&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Therefore, a ServiceBundleSpec templatizes the invariant characteristics and behavior of this service bundling."/>

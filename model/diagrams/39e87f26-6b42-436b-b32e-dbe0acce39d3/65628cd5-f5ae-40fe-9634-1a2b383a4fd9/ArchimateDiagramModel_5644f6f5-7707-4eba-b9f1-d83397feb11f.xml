The first is to associate Resources to Products and Services, and provide a detailed enough set of Resource entities (organized as ABEs) to facilitate this association. The second is to ensure that Resources can support and deliver Services offered by the enterprise. Management of resources involves planning, configuration, and monitoring to capture performance, usage, and security information. This also includes the ability to reconfigure Resources in order to fine tune performance, respond to faults, and correct operational deficiencies in the infrastructure. Resources also provide usage information which is subsequently aggregated to the customer level for billing purposes. The final objective of the Resource domain is to enable strategy and planning processes to be defined. Entities in the Resource domain may be associated with processes that involve planning new and/or enhanced Services, or even the retirement of Services, offered by the Enterprise.">
